This was my first web-based project in my final semester of college. During my project work, I learned things like HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. It was a great experience making a clone of Resumonk.
- Making Resume is a very hectic work for all students. Also, many companies judge the candidature of a student just by his/her Resume. So it is necessary for the student to think beyond the third dimension while making the Resume.
- Resumonk(online resume builder) is the Web Application that helps students to get their resume in hand just by filling up a simple form where important credentials need to be filled in.
- Fully responsive design - You are no longer dependent on computers, you can quickly search for information using various devices: laptops, smartphones, tablets, and even smartwatches
